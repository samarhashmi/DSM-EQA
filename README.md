## Overview

DSM-EQA is a benchmark and evaluation framework for energy-domain question answering under hard physical constraints. Every sample in the dataset satisfies three constraint classes taken directly from power-systems engineering:

| Constraint | Expression | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| Power balance | \|p\_gen − p\_load − p\_loss\| | ≤ 2% of p\_load |
| Voltage security | v\_min, v\_max | 0.95 – 1.05 pu |
| Thermal safety | u\_line | ≤ 1.00 pu |

The framework trains a multimodal LLM that jointly produces a fluent natural-language answer **and** a physically feasible numerical output vector, using these constraints as a differentiable regularisation term during fine-tuning.

| Reasoning | 40% | Single-chain causal or corrective reasoning |
| Multi-step | 20% | Multi-hop reasoning across dispatch, voltage, and thermal domains |

### Data generation

The QA benchmark was constructed through three sequential stages:

1. Physics-consistent numerical system states were generated under the three   constraint classes stated in Section 5.1 of the paper, parameterised from   published IEEE 14-, 30-, and 118-bus test case specifications.
   All 10 000 samples satisfy these constraints (verified programmatically).

2. Seventy-two question templates (12 per category) were instantiated with  scenario-specific parameters spanning factual retrieval through multi-step  reasoning.

3. Three certified grid operators independently  reviewed every candidate pair for physical feasibility and operational  realism, discarding any pair failing either criterion (Cohen's κ = 0.79).  The final benchmark comprises 23% directly human-authored questions drawn from anonymised operator query logs and 77% operator-validated template items.

## QA examples

### Demand forecasting - factual

**Operator:** What is the predicted peak demand for the Southwest region on 14 July 2023?

**DSM-EQA:** The predicted peak demand for the Southwest region on 14 July 2023 is 4,823 MW, driven by elevated temperatures and high cooling loads during the 13:00–17:00 afternoon window. Total generation is scheduled at 4,850 MW to cover the ±5% forecast uncertainty band. Voltage profiles across all 118 monitored buses remain within 0.95-1.05 pu and no thermal violations are present.

`[p_gen=4850.2 MW | v_min=0.971 pu | u_line=0.84 pu ✓]`

---

### Grid operations - multi-step

**Operator:** N-1 contingency on line 47-69. What generation re-dispatch restores security?

**DSM-EQA:** N-1 outage on line 47-69 creates a 340 MW loop flow violation on the parallel path through buses 46-68-69, now loaded at 1.08 pu. Minimum-cost re-dispatch: reduce Unit 22 by 180 MW (580→400 MW) and increase Unit 31 by 180 MW (240→420 MW). Lines 46-68 and 68-69 return to 0.88 and 0.91 pu respectively. Cost uplift is 4,140 USD/hour. N-1 security confirmed on all 186 contingencies. 

`[p_gen=4498.4 MW | v_min=0.966 pu | u_line=0.93 pu ✓]`

---

### Anomaly detection - critical multi-step

**Operator:** Cascading voltage collapse is imminent on the Northwestern interface voltages below 0.92 pu on four buses. What emergency actions prevent a blackout?

DSM-EQA: Blackout prevention requires immediate sequential execution:

1. Shed 380 MW in load zones NW-2 and NW-3 within 60 seconds
2. Insert 320 MVAR of reactive compensation within 90 seconds
3. Reduce power imports from the South by 240 MW within 3 minutes
4. Arm automatic voltage control relays on buses 87, 89, and 91

Post-intervention:
- Lowest bus voltage stabilises at 0.953 pu, above the 0.95 pu security limit

`[p_gen=4218.4 MW | v_min=0.953 pu | u_line=0.97 pu ✓]`

---

## Expert validation

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Number of evaluators | 5 certified power system engineers |
| Evaluation protocol | Blinded to model identity |
| Inter-rater agreement | Krippendorff's α = 0.76 |
| Operator decision alignment | 91% on three real grid events |
